User stories<br>
1. As a user, I want to see a home screen with all the available cities on the API.<br> DONE<br><br>
2. As a user, I want the cities to sort alphabetically.<br> DONE<br><br>
3. As a user, I want to "press-to-re-fetch" the data (not the page) on all pages.<br> DONE<br><br>
4. As a user, I want to click on a city and see the weather results on a separate detail screen.<br> DONE<br><br>
5. As a user, I want all the temperatures to display in Celsius. The API also returns
Fahrenheit and Kelvin, so they need to convert:<br><br>
Celsius = Kelvin - 273.15
Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) / 1.8<br> DONE .<br><br>
6. As a user, I want the temperatures to display in chronological order<br> DONE<br><br>
7. As a user, I want to have the ability to hide/unhide a city and persist my choice after a page reload.<br> DONE <br><br>
<br><br>
I share view of the app below.<br><br>
