Semih ERDOGAN - SIMPLE COUNTRY SEARCH <br><br>
- I started developing with typescript template on "npx create-react-app"
- I used mobile first responsive approach.<br><br>
The app can be run in the development mode by typing "npm start" in the project directory of the terminal.<br>
http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.<br><br>
Libraries Used:<br>
- cors-anywhere<br>
- axios<br>
- react-testing-library<br>
- react-router-dom<br><br>
User stories<br>
1. As a user, I want to see a home screen with all the available cities on the API.
2. As a user, I want the cities to sort alphabetically.
3. As a user, I want to "press-to-re-fetch" the data (not the page) on all pages.
4. As a user, I want to click on a city and see the weather results on a separate detail screen.
5. As a user, I want all the temperatures to display in Celsius. The API also returns
Fahrenheit and Kelvin, so they need to convert:<br><br>
Celsius = Kelvin - 273.15
Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) / 1.8
6. As a user, I want the temperatures to display in chronological order
7. As a user, I want to have the ability to hide/unhide a city and persist my choice after a page reload.

I share view of the app below.<br><br>
